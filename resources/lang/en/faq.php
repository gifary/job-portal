<p><strong>How long should the hiring process take?</strong><br />
There are no set time frames for the hiring process within Qatar Airways, but the recruiting team do work to make every process as quick as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any vacancies in _______?</strong><br />
Please review our careers site for available opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>I was interviewed and haven&rsquo;t heard back yet?</strong><br />
The processing time post-interview can take a while, often longer than the hiring manager or recruiter thought during the interview.&nbsp; Qatar Airways wants to expedite every hiring process, and will get back to you as soon as there is a decision on the next steps.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Can I apply for this role?</strong><br />
Applicants are always welcome to apply for roles, however Qatar Airways would provide the following advice:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Only apply for roles where you closely match the stated requirements</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Applying for a wide variety of roles will not look good to recruiters or hiring managers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Local candidates (Indonesian) are always preferred.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t I selected/hired?</strong><br />
Qatar Airways receives a lot of interest for some roles, and even qualified candidates might not be selected for further interview if there are even more suitable candidates applying.&nbsp; We are not able to discuss individual cases, nor are we able to provide applicants with a specific reason why they were not successful.</p>
